# connect-to-census

In this assignment, you will connect your data to census data and do a bit of basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on your dataset. The EDA will be:
* 1-D (distribution of your data) 
* 2-D scatterplots (comparing your data to census variables)

## Assignment

Identify the geospatial columns in your data. You may have addresses or latitude and longitude. In this assignment you will 

### Part 1: Geocoding your data and joining it with Census data

1. In the `connect-to-census.ipynb` notebook, add code to:

    a. download your data

    b. convert addresses --> lat/long (if the data doesn't already have lat/long)
    
    c. convert lat/long to census geography codes (like 'GEOID', 'STATE', 'COUNTY', 'TRACT', 'BLOCK', etc...). you may want to have more than one level of geography so you can do the analysis at different levels later on.
    
    d. this notebook should output a file containing your data and the census geographies you're interested in.

    Example notebooks to help you with all this will live in [this repository](https://github.com/data4news/census-examples). You may use R or Python (or a combination of the two).


2. In `merge-with-census.ipynb` notebook, download some census data using `tidycensus` and merge it with your data.

### Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

1. In the `distributions.ipynb` notebook, do some basic exploratory data analysis on **your dataset** in one dimension. Here you will explore the **distributions** of your data (histograms, boxplots, dotplots, etc). You may have already done this in the planning phase. If you haven't changed topics, feel free to just drop that notebook in as your distributions.ipynb notebook.

2. In the `scatterplots.ipynb` notebook, do some basic exploratory data analysis on your data, but this time, merge in some census variables you're interested in and make some **scatterplots** with a variable from **your dataset** as the Y and variables from the **census data** as the X. 

### Part 3: Write up your findings

1. In a new google doc, summarize what you've found so far. Think of this as a short memo of what you've done or the progress you've made towards pitching a story on this topic or using this dataset. You don't need to show all the charts, just the ones you found most interesting. What questions do you have that you'd like to dig more into? Do you think you've got an idea for a story angle? Write it informally as a memo to Dhrumil and Shivangi (your editors). 

## Usage

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and put in your census API key. 
   
    _(FYI there is a file in this repo called `.gitignore` that will prevent `.env` from being tracked by git so you don't push your census key on accident._

2. Run the notebooks. If you're unfamiliar with this setup, see https://github.com/dmil/jupyter-quickstart/

## Note about large files

If your data is too big (bigger than ~50MB), just upload the code to transform your data, not the data itself. If you want to make sure to never upload the datafile to git, just add the name of the file to the `.gitignore` file.
